# dotfiles

Set of dotfiles for my main workstations. Usually something I would like to refer or remember.

Current spec: M1 Pro CPU (10-core), 14-core GPU, 32GB RAM, 512GB SSD
  
Synced with [gbck](https://github.com/jukben/gbck) witch is bit broken, but I'm too lazy to fix it. Drop me message on Twitter if you would like to use it. It's possible, it's just not so intuitive ðŸ¤“
